# Notebooks

This folder will host exploratory notebooks for the fraud detection project:

- `eda-fraud-data.ipynb` – exploratory analysis for the e-commerce dataset.
- `eda-creditcard.ipynb` – exploratory analysis for the credit card dataset.
- `feature-engineering.ipynb` – experiments on engineered features and transformations.
- `modeling.ipynb` – baseline and ensemble model experiments.
- `shap-explainability.ipynb` – explainability artefacts for the final submission.

Notebooks are excluded from the interim submission to keep the repository light. Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory for reproducible pipelines.
